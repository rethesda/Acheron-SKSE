# Papyrus API

| `RemoveOption(string id)` | Removes custom option by ID. |
| `HasOption(string id)` | Checks whether option exists. |
| `GetOptionID(string id)` | Resolves option ID (`0..3` for built-ins, custom start at `4`). |

### Menu (`AcheronHunterPride`)

| Function | Behavior |
|---|---|

## Utility Functions (`Acheron`)

| Function | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `PrintConsole(string message)` | Prints message to game console. |
| `OpenCustomMenu(string swfPathWithoutExt)` | Opens custom menu from `Data/Interface/<path>.swf`. Returns false if invalid path, file missing, or menu already open. |

## Object Reference Functions (`Acheron`)

| Function | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `SetLinkedRef(ObjectReference object, ObjectReference target, Keyword keyword)` | Sets linked ref on source object. |
| `GetItemsByKeywords(ObjectReference container, Keyword[] keywords, int minValue, bool includeQuestItems)` | Returns forms matching filters. |
| `RemoveAllItems(ObjectReference from, ObjectReference to, bool excludeWorn)` | Moves/removes items with runtime reason based on target type. |

## Event Registration (`Acheron`)

Registration helpers require a non-None receiver object. If receiver is `None`, registration traces and no-ops.

### Actor Defeated

- `RegisterForActorDefeated(Form receiver)`
- `UnregisterForActorDefeated(Form receiver)`
- `RegisterForActorDefeated_Alias(ReferenceAlias receiver)`
- `UnregisterForActorDefeated_Alias(ReferenceAlias receiver)`
- `RegisterForActorDefeated_MgEff(ActiveMagicEffect receiver)`
- `UnregisterForActorDefeated_MgEff(ActiveMagicEffect receiver)`

### Actor Rescued

- `RegisterForActorRescued(Form receiver)`
- `UnregisterForActorRescued(Form receiver)`
- `RegisterForActorRescued_Alias(ReferenceAlias receiver)`
- `UnregisterForActorRescued_Alias(ReferenceAlias receiver)`
- `RegisterForActorRescued_MgEff(ActiveMagicEffect receiver)`
- `UnregisterForActorRescued_MgEff(ActiveMagicEffect receiver)`

### Hunter Pride Selection

- `RegisterForHunterPrideSelect(Form receiver)`
- `UnregisterForHunterPrideSelect(Form receiver)`
- `RegisterForHunterPrideSelect_Alias(ReferenceAlias receiver)`
- `UnregisterForHunterPrideSelect_Alias(ReferenceAlias receiver)`
- `RegisterForHunterPrideSelect_MgEff(ActiveMagicEffect receiver)`
- `UnregisterForHunterPrideSelect_MgEff(ActiveMagicEffect receiver)`

## Example: Custom Hunter Pride Option

```papyrus
Event OnInit()
    int optionID = Acheron.AddOption(
        "MyOption",
        "$MyOptionName",
        "Interface\\Acheron\\MyOption.dds",
        "{\"target\":{\"is\":[\"nonessential\"]}}"
    )

    if optionID >= 0
        Acheron.RegisterForHunterPrideSelect(self)
    endif
EndEvent

Event OnHunterPrideSelect(int aiOptionID, Actor akTarget)
    if aiOptionID == Acheron.GetOptionID("MyOption")
        Debug.Trace("My option selected")
    endif
EndEvent
```

## Notes

- Passing empty option IDs to option helpers traces and fails.
- Most actor/object functions trace and return safe defaults when passed `None`.
- `OpenCustomMenu` is not available in VR builds.
